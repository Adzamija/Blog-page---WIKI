## Description:
This project was created as a requirement for the course CS50W(Harvard University). The main objective of this project was to create a web application that emulates the functionality of Wikipedia, allowing users to browse, search, and create entries on various topics.

The project was developed using Python 3 Django web framework, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

The application allows users to create, edit and delete entries. The homepage displays a list of all entries in the database, while clicking on any entry will display its content. Additionally, users can search for an entry using the search bar on the homepage.

Although the design was not the primary focus of the project, Bootstrap and CSS were utilized to make the application more aesthetically pleasing.
